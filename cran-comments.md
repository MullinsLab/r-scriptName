# Update

This is an update.  This version:

* Adjusts purrr usage to accommodate backwards-incompatible API changes that
  caused this package to be archived from CRAN.
* Stops using a now-deprecated rlang API which produces warnings.


# Test environments

* r-hub
    - Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS, R-release (3.6.0), GCC
    - Fedora Linux, R-devel (2019-06-14 r76701), clang, gfortran
    - Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, R-devel (2019-06-11 r76694), 32/64 bit


# R CMD check results
