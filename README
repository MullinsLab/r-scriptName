_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     ‘current_filename()’ returns the result of
     ‘current_source_filename()’ if not NULL, otherwise the result of
     ‘current_cli_filename()’, which might be NULL.  You should use
     this wrapper function rather than the more-specific functions
     unless you have a very specific need.

     ‘current_source_filename()’ returns the filename from the most
     recent call to ‘source’ in the current call stack.  From within a
     sourced script, this is the filename of the script itself.

     ‘current_cli_filename()’ returns the filename found on the command
     line invocation of R or Rscript.  This may or may not be the
     caller's file if there's been an intervening ‘source’.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A character vector of length 1 if a script name can be found,
     otherwise NULL.  No manipulation is done to the filename, so it
     may be relative or absolute.
